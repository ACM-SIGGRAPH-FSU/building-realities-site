# Building Worlds, the Art + Technolgy Hackathon

This is the repository for ACM SIGGRAPH @ FSU's hackathon website.

## The teaser site

The first site is the teaser site, used to give information about the event before we are ready to accept sign-ups. It serves a few key functions:

1. Give the prospective date for the event.
2. Get viewers interested in the event.
3. Offer sponsors and organizers a place to sign up.
4. Prominently display our brand.
